instalation and basic configuration with helm chart of prometheus:

- https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack

1. - helm install [RELEASE_NAME] prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack




configuring prometheus to report metrics of any service i choose:


1. for every k8 service, inorder to see its metrics, a proper exporter for it must be configured
    configure: 
        - a proper uri
        - the correct label in order for prometheus to scrape the metrics of that certain resorce(release: prometheus ) in my case

for example:

mysql:
  uri: "mysql//:<name of service>:<service port>"

serviceMonitor:
  additionalLables:
    release: prometheus


2. after this is configured you can install the exporter for the desirde resorce

exmp: helm install <realese name> prometheus-community/prometheus-mysql-exporter -f <values i want to inject>

then check: 

 after i launched the mysql exporter it created:
    - the exporter itsel ( run kgp)
    - a service for that pod (k get svc)
    *** it was suposed to create a servicemonitor but it didnt ( check why)

3. after that run the following command to see its metrics:
- k port-forward svc/<svc name of the created exporter> <port of that svc>
