connecting my app with the DB on EKS using Helm Chart:

- when i tried to launch my app and it didnt initialize
due to " notesdb not found, it was because it didnt create the notesdb DB in the mysql data base.
to check this i ran:" CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS notesdb; " inside one of the mysql DB
this worked bit obviously this is not an ideal solution, so i uninstalled the helm chart, and when i installed it again it worked without
running the CREATE.... command, very weird...
